            Students deserve more than guesswork about their futures. <br />
            <br />✅ Overwhelmed by endless career options with no clear
            direction <br />
            ✅ Limited access to personalized guidance from counselors <br />✅
            Struggling to connect skills and interests to real career paths{" "}

            <br />
            <br />
            Students are stuck in a cycle of uncertainty — stressed, confused,
            and unsure about their next steps. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Here’s why:</strong> <br />
            <br />
            1️⃣ Too many choices without tools to narrow them down <br />
            <br />
            2️⃣ Generic advice that doesn’t fit individual strengths <br />
            <br />
            3️⃣ Lack of data-driven insights to match potential to careers <br />
            <br />
            4️⃣ Hit a wall in planning their futures without confidence <br />
            <br />
            You’ve got potential. Now it’s time to find your path — without
            wasting time on confusion or outdated advice. <br />
